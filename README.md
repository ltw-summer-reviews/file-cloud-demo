Create a simple demo application for a company called “File Cloud”—the purpose is to show off a few of the interface’s features.

In the downloadable assets there are Illustrator files for all the icons and logos to be used in the interface, as well as two different mockups.

The Javascript file included in the download is a list of all the files to be used in the interface, *it cannot be changed*, only linked to in your HTML and used to generate the file list.

The Javascript application should have the following features:

1. When the page loads, it should loop over everything in `files` and display them on the screen.
2. When hovering over a file, a delete button becomes visible, once clicked the file fades out and is removed.
3. Across the top is a toolbar that allows sorting the files by type, clicking on each type shows only those files—there’s an “All” button to reset the display.
4. Pressing the sign out button reloads the page, refreshing all the data.

For an extra challenge make the website better for all users:

- Make the application fully accessible for keyboard users and screen reader users.
- Make the website super performant, following a performance budget.
